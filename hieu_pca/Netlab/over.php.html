  Overview and Examples

The latest release of Netlab includes the following algorithms:

    * PCA
    * Mixtures of probabilistic PCA
    * Gaussian mixture model with EM training algorithm
    * Linear and logistic regression with IRLS training algorithm
    * Multi-layer perceptron with linear, logistic and softmax outputs
      and appropriate error functions
    * Radial basis function (RBF) networks with both Gaussian and
      non-local basis functions
    * Optimisers, including quasi-Newton methods, conjugate gradients
      and scaled conjugate gradients
    * Multi-layer perceptron with Gaussian mixture outputs (mixture
      density networks)
    * Gaussian prior distributions over parameters for the MLP, RBF and
      GLM including multiple hyper-parameters
    * Laplace approximation framework for Bayesian inference (evidence
      procedure)
    * Automatic Relevance Determination for input selection
    * Markov chain Monte-Carlo including simple Metropolis and hybrid
      Monte-Carlo
    * K-nearest neighbour classifier
    * K-means clustering
    * Generative Topographic Map
    * Neuroscale topographic projection
    * Gaussian Processes
    * Hinton diagrams for network weights
    * Self-organising map 

The integration with Matlab means that powerful facilities are available
to pre-process the data, graph important variables, and visualise
results. In addition, Matlab programs that use Netlab are portable
across all main platforms and operating systems (including UNIX®,
Microsoft Windows95® and Apple Macintosh® environments).


    Backwards compatibility

As far as I know, there are only two areas where there are backwards
compatibility issues between release 3.2 and earlier releases.

    * Certain networks (of MLP and MDN types) trained under earlier
      versions of the toolkit will not work with the new functions. This
      is due to a change of name of one field in the new data structure.
      It can be corrected by running the Netlab function |convertoldnet|
      after the network has been loaded in Matlab. This function works
      correctly with all networks, both version 3.2 and earlier.
    * The K-nearest-neighbour implementation now involves a data
      structure (to store the training data) so has separate creation
      and running functions |knn| and |knnfwd| respectively. See
      |demknn| for an example of how these should be used. 

Documentation is provided in two forms: brief information is provided
via the Matlab help system, while a full on-line reference manual is
supplied in HTML, which can be read with any suitable browser (such as
Netscape®). Netlab is provided with demonstration programs and data sets
to illustrate its use on a variety of problems.

Netlab is implemented as a set of functions written in the Matlab
language and requires the Matlab environment to run. Matlab is an
extendible technical computing environment offering powerful numeric
computation and visualisation tools. Netlab uses only core Matlab
functions, so is not dependent on any of the optional toolboxes.

network functions drawn from a Gaussian prior over weights in which the
effect of changing individual hyper-parameters can be explored./
