Motivation
----------

Miyawaki dataset is available online. However, its format is no easy to use
with common mri tools and from python. As we had to put it in a more common
format to use it for our own purpose, we decided to put it also online so
that people can use it.

The NIfTI format has been chosen for fMRI data. They are easily viewable in
programs such as mricron or fslview. Same format has been used for masks.

The CSV format has been chosen for labels. In fact, this is easily loadable
from Python or Matlab. Fortran column order has been kept as it is standard
in Matlab.

Conversion
----------

The script used to convert data is provided in this package
(convert_miyawaki.py).

To run it, you will need :
- preprocessed .mat files and supple.mat from brainline website:
    http://brainliner.jp/data/brainliner-admin/Reconstruct
- a typical neuro-scientific python install including:
    - scipy
    - numpy
    - nibabel (to create NIfTI images)
    - h5py (to read matlab files)
- the script convert_miyawaki.py

Then, simply run the script, files will be stored in a folder named
miyawaki2008.
$ python convert_miyawaki.py
