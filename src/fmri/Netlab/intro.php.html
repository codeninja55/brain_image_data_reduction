  How to use Netlab

Of course, one of the best ways of learning how to use Netlab is to run
and examine the demo programs. Every major function in the library has
at least one associated demonstration. Each demo has the prefix |dem| in
its name.

Two demos that are particularly useful when getting started are

    * |demnlab| is a simple GUI that allows you to select and run Netlab
      demos
    * |demtrain| demonstrates how a neural network can be trained to
      solve classification and regression problems: it reads in datasets
      in the Netlab data format. <#DataFormat> 


      Models and Structures

Every model of any complexity (all except K nearest neighbour) is
manipulated as a Matlab data structure. This ensures that all the
relevant information is kept together, and prevents the user from
passing models to the wrong function. Each model has a `constructor'
function that builds and initialises the relevant data structure. Each
model has a three letter prefix that is used for all of its associated
functions.

For example, the Gaussian mixture model has the prefix |gmm|. A call to
the constructor

net = gmm(1, 2, 'spherical');

generates the following data structure

          type: 'gmm'
           nin: 1
      ncentres: 2
       nparams: 6
    covar_type: 'spherical'
        priors: [0.5000 0.5000]
       centres: [2x1 double]
        covars: [1 1]

We have not developed the code in a fully object oriented fashion for
simplicity. To access fields in this structure, for example, the
centres, use the |.| operator:

net.centres

The models have been designed to have compatible data structures. The
Gaussian mixture model is used when training RBF networks and in Mixture
Density Networks.

Because models are represented by a single data structure, it is very
easy to save and load them. The command

save gmm.net net

saves the Gaussian mixture model |net| to the file |gmm.net|.


      Training and Optimisers

The optimisers are compatible with the Matlab optimisation toolbox. In
particular, they make use of the |options| vector to control the way the
algorithm works, set termination conditions etc. (For more information
on the meaning of the fields in this vector, see the Matlab help on
|foptions| and the help for each optimisation function.) There is one
significant difference in the treatment of termination criteria. If the
tolerance is set to 0, then in Netlab, the optimisation function will
continue until the required number of steps have been taken, whereas in
Matlab, the values are overwritten with the default |1e-4|. All Netlab
optimisation routines assume that there is a function available that
computes the gradient of the function being optimised.

Because the optimisers (with the exception of the on-line gradient
descent optimiser |olgd| which is specifically for training network
models) are general purpose, they operate in `parameter vector' space.
However, the model parameter vectors are held in the corresponding data
structure. To apply the optimisers to network training, three utility
functions |netopt, neterr, netgrad| are provided. Examples of their use
can be found in |demmlp1.m|. For example, use the following line of code
to train a network data structure with input data |x| and target data
|t| using the quasi-Newton training algorithm

[net, options] = netopt(net, options, x, t, 'quasinew');

This mechanism relies upon the following assumptions:

    * The network data structure |net| contains the function prefix (for
      example, |mlp|) in a field called |type|.
    * The function that computes the error is called |<prefix>err|, for
      example |mlperr|.
    * The function that computes the error gradient is called
      |<prefix>grad|, for example |mlpgrad|.
    * There is function |<prefix>pak| (for example, |mlppak|) which
      packs all the component parameter vectors in the network data
      structure into one single vector.
    * There is function |<prefix>unpak| (for example, |mlpunpak|) which
      unpacks a single parameter vector into its component vectors in a
      network data structure. 

If you extend Netlab by adding new models, then you should ensure that
you follow these conventions if you want to use optimisation functions
to train them.


      A Simple Program

The "Hello world" equivalent in Netlab is a programme that generates
some data, trains an MLP, and plots its predictions.

% Generate the matrix of inputs x and targets t.
x = [0:1/19:1]';
t = sin(2*pi*x) + 0.2*randn(ndata, 1);

% Set up network parameters.
net = mlp(1, 3, 1, 'linear');

% Set up vector of options for the optimiser.
options = zeros(1,18);
options(1) = 1;			% This provides display of error values.
options(9) = 1;			% Check the gradient calculations.
options(14) = 100;		% Number of training cycles. 

% Train using scaled conjugate gradients.
[net, options] = netopt(net, options, x, t, 'scg');

% Plot the trained network predictions.
plotvals = [0:0.01:1]';
y = mlpfwd(net, plotvals);
plot(plotvals, y, 'ob')

A fuller version of this program is contained in |demmlp1.m|


      Data Format and Sample Datasets

As well as the usual Matlab data file formats, Netlab provides two
utility functions |datread| and |datwrite| to read and write data files
respectively. The data is stored in a text file with a short header
followed by the data itself. The header has the form

nin   2
nout  1
ndata 12

where |nin| specifies the number of input variables, |nout| the number
of output variables, and |ndata| the number of data points. Each
subsequent line corresponds to a single example, with the first |nin|
values for the input variables, and the remaining |nout| values for the
output variables. For unsupervised learning problems, |nout| can be zero.

Netlab is supplied with two datasets: the ubiquitous exclusive or
problem |xor.dat|, and oil pipeline data |oilTrn.dat| and |oilTst.dat|.
The latter is synthetic data modelling non-intrusive measurements on a
pipeline transporting a mixture of oil, water and gas. the inputs are
twelve measures of gamma beam attenuation, and the two outputs represent
the fraction of water and the fraction of oil. Each dataset contains 500
examples. This link
